It is your final exam at University of Felines. You must make your mama cat proud by answering 10 multiple choice questions correctly. The student with the most answers correct wins. 

### Mini Game: Count Mice

You have nine tries to guess the number of mice in the room. There can be up to 25 mice per room. Thankfully, you have a buddy telling you if your guess is higher, or lower than the number. The first user to guess correctly 3 times wins!

### Competition Mode

Competitions are the focus of the game! Each round the players are prompted to either: attack, defend, or retreat (forefit). Using a highly sofisticated algorithm, a result outcome for each move is calculated based on the cats' traits and luck. For instance, if both cats decide to attack in a turn, the cat with the most strength at the given time of the move will over take the other. Each attack will inflict damage to the cat's energy level. After six rounds, the cat with the least energy looses the competition.

## PawzMart
