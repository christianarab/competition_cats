# Player belongs to user. Each player will have the feature to have, pick, and select cats for competition.
# Players will have currency (pawz) to purchase upgrades for their cats to be used in games. They will start with 400pawz.
# Players tokens will determine how many games the User can enter. By default, players start with 5 - equal to 5 games.
# Players will automatically save and load according to their game outcomes, point usage, etc.
# Todo: add cat selection flow, ability to view cats at hand
